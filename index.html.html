    <title>Yours Truly - Conversational Journaling</title>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Yours Truly</h1>
        <p>✨ “Because your words deserve to be heard.”</p>

        <h2>💡 What It Is:</h2>
        <p>Yours Truly is a journaling app that doesn’t just listen—it writes back.</p>
        <p>You write freely about your day, your emotions, your chaos, your calm—and Yours Truly responds like a tender, thoughtful friend. Not a therapist. Not a motivational speaker. Just… someone who gets it.</p>

        <h2>💬 How It Works:</h2>
        <div id="conversation">
            <div id="user-input-area">
                <label for="userEntry">Your Entry:</label><br>
                <textarea id="userEntry" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea><br>
                <button id="submitEntry">Send</button>
            </div>
            <div id="response-area"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Optional: You reply back. A conversation begins. Sometimes it asks a question. Sometimes it just sits with you.</p>
        <p>Over time, it remembers your patterns, your fears, your wins, and speaks back with increasing familiarity and emotional depth.</p>

        <h2>❤ Why It’s Different:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Conversational journaling: You’re not just writing—you’re being heard.</li>
            <li>Emotional intelligence meets warmth: Think more “pen pal who sees your soul” than “AI chatbot.”</li>
            <li>Non-linear memory: It gently references past entries ("You mentioned this feeling back in December") for beautiful, human-like continuity.</li>
            <li>Custom voice modes: Choose tone: reflective, poetic, affirming, or quietly questioning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🎯 Target Audience:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gen Z & millennials who already dabble in journaling or self-care</li>
            <li>Burnout survivors, overthinkers, and people in transition</li>
            <li>Fans of mindfulness, poetry, mood tracking, or creative writing</li>
            <li>People who want connection, but on their own terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🖼 Visual & Brand Style:</h2>
        <p>Soft pastels, handwriting fonts, warm parchment tones</p>
        <p>UI inspired by letters, envelopes, and typewriter textures</p>
        <p>Soundtrack: light piano, ambient warmth (optional background sound while writing)</p>

        <h2>🪞 Example Brand Copy:</h2>
        <p>“You write. It listens. Then it writes back, with words you didn’t know you needed.”</p>
        <p>Yours Truly – more than a journal, a conversation with yourself.</p>
