            <h1>Yours Truly</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>💡 What It Is:</h2>
        <p>Yours Truly is a journaling app that doesn’t just listen—it writes back.</p>
        <p>You write freely about your day, your emotions, your chaos, your calm—and Yours Truly responds like a tender, thoughtful friend. Not a therapist. Not a motivational speaker. Just… someone who gets it.</p>

        <h2>💬 How It Works:</h2>
        <div id="conversation">
            <div id="user-input-area">
                <label for="userEntry">Your Entry:</label><br>
                <textarea id="userEntry" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea><br>
                <button id="submitEntry">Send</button>
            </div>
            <div id="response-area"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Optional: You reply back. A conversation begins. Sometimes it asks a question. Sometimes it just sits with you.</p>
        <p>Over time, it remembers your patterns, your fears, your wins, and speaks back with increasing familiarity and emotional depth.</p>

        <h2>❤ Why It’s Different:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Conversational journaling: You’re not just writing—you’re being heard.</li>
            <li>Emotional intelligence meets warmth: Think more “pen pal who sees your soul” than “AI chatbot.”</li>
            <li>Non-linear memory: It gently references past entries ("You mentioned this feeling back in December") for beautiful, human-like continuity.</li>
            <li>Custom voice modes: Choose tone: reflective, poetic, affirming, or quietly questioning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🎯 Whom this is meant for:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gen Z & millennials who already dabble in journaling or self-care</li>
            <li>Burnout survivors, overthinkers, and people in transition</li>
            <li>Fans of mindfulness, poetry, mood tracking, or creative writing</li>
            <li>People who want connection, but on their own terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚠️ Important Usage Information and Warnings:</h2>
        <p><strong>How to Use Yours Truly:</strong></p>
        <p>Yours Truly is designed to be a safe space for personal reflection and conversation. Write freely about your thoughts and feelings, and allow the app to respond. Remember, it's a conversational tool, not a substitute for professional mental health support.</p>

        <p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not a Substitute for Professional Help:</strong> Yours Truly is not a replacement for therapy or counseling. If you are experiencing severe emotional distress or mental health issues, please seek professional help.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Be mindful of the information you share. Avoid disclosing sensitive personal details.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Triggers:</strong> The app may occasionally touch on sensitive topics. If you find a response triggering, please take a break and prioritize your well-being.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Yours Truly is an AI and does not have the same understanding or empathy as a human therapist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🪞 Our motto:</h2>
        <p>“Talk to yourself, in a whole new way.”</p>
        <p>Yours Truly – more than a journal, a conversation with yourself.</p>
